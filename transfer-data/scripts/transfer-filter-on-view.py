Lists the contents of whatever is in a remote directory
https://docs.globus.org/api/transfer/file_operations/#dir_listing_filtering

Results are filtered based on set criteria. This is useful if you have to work with a dataset that was already
  delivered, and want to guarantee operations are only performed on certain results. For example, a workflow
  may not want to add everything to the search index (think OS-default "junk files", or QC script debug logs)

If you are an enduser, the official Globus CLI provides a more convenient command:
  `globus ls [OPTIONS] ENDPOINT_ID[:PATH]`

This script is primarily useful for educational purposes, showing how you can write your own automation scripts/ flows.

This script is called via CLI.
